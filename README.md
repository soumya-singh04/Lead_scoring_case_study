# Lead Scoring Case Study

### Problem Statement

X Education, an online education company, faces a challenge with its lead conversion process. The company acquires a large number of leads daily through various channels such as website visits, referrals, and marketing campaigns. However, only about 30% of these leads are typically converted into paying customers. 

To improve the efficiency of the sales team, the company wants to identify the "Hot Leads," i.e., the leads most likely to convert into paying customers. This would enable the sales team to focus their efforts on the most promising leads and improve the overall conversion rate, which the CEO has set a target of around 80%. 

The goal is to build a model that assigns a lead score to each lead, with higher scores indicating higher chances of conversion. The dataset provided contains various attributes like "Lead Source," "Total Time Spent on Website," "Total Visits," "Last Activity," and others that might help predict the likelihood of conversion. The target variable, "Converted," indicates whether a lead was converted (1) or not (0). 

The company also faces the challenge of handling missing or ambiguous values in categorical variables, particularly the 'Select' option, which represents missing or null data.

### Business Objective

The primary business objective is to build a **Logistic Regression model** that assigns a lead score ranging from 0 to 100 to each lead. Leads with higher scores are more likely to convert, and leads with lower scores have a lower likelihood of conversion. This model will enable the sales team at X Education to prioritize their efforts, focusing on high-potential leads and improving the overall lead conversion rate.

The key objectives are as follows:
- **Model Development:** Develop a logistic regression model to predict lead conversion based on historical data.
- **Lead Scoring:** Generate lead scores to classify leads into high-potential and low-potential categories.
- **Efficiency Improvement:** Help the sales team target the most promising leads and increase the overall conversion rate towards the company's target of 80%.
- **Data Handling:** Address issues related to missing or inconsistent values, especially in categorical variables such as 'Select,' which must be treated as null values.

This project aims to provide X Education with a tool that enhances its lead conversion process, ultimately driving higher sales and more efficient use of resources in the sales funnel.
